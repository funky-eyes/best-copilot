description: "Create the target repository's local AI instruction scaffold during first-use bootstrap. Use from repo-init-scan when `.github/instructions`, runtime adapters such as `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, or the neutral project facts scaffold are missing. Do not use to overwrite existing project-specific rules."

# Target Instructions Bootstrap

Create or repair target-local instruction entrypoints during `repo-init-scan`. The neutral project facts scaffold is not enough to pass initialization until `repo-init-scan` replaces neutral markers with bounded repository facts or bounded-scan `unknown` gaps, verifies required artifacts, and writes the root `best-copilot.md` sentinel.

Load `references/templates.md` for exact file contents and repair snippets.

## Boundary

- Write into the target repository, never into the installed plugin package or plugin cache.
- Create missing files only. Preserve existing project-specific instructions.
- If an existing file lacks a required compatible section, append the smallest compatible section instead of replacing the file.
- Do not copy this plugin repository's active state, specs, memory, or private workflow examples into the target repository.
- Keep generated target files short and runtime-neutral unless a runtime-specific adapter is explicitly requested.
- Do not generate hooks or script-based enforcement; init, native ask, closeout, and state sync gates must be instruction-text enforceable.
- Do not create `best-copilot.md` here. Only `repo-init-scan` writes the verified-init sentinel after full verification.

## Verified Init Sentinel

`repo-init-scan` writes target root `best-copilot.md` only after full init verification:

```md
---
version: "0.6.1"
---
```

## Files

Create when absent, repair only compatible missing sections when present:

- `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/skills-index.instructions.md`
- `AGENTS.md` when Codex compatibility is requested or current runtime needs it
- `CLAUDE.md` when Claude Code compatibility is requested or current runtime is Claude Code
- `.claude/settings.json` when Claude Code needs a stable Senior Project Expert session entry and current-branch worktree base

## Required Local Rules

Target `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md` must cover:

- source priority and language policy
- request flow, per-request timestamp, init normalization, and packet freeze
- reliability gates: think before coding, simplicity, surgical changes, read before writing, verification evidence
- native ask and no-silent-closeout rules
- PM/specialist ask boundary
- shared `work_mode`, `task_type`, and specialist handback vocabulary
- search precision and command output budget
- memory/spec progressive disclosure
- first-use scaffold gate
- Spec Bundle rule for MEDIUM/LARGE work
- `STATE_SYNC`: task status changes update `tasks.md` and `memories/repo/current-workstreams.md` before continuing
- agents/dispatch and cross-review lanes
- implementation/review/verification requirements

## Repair Rules

- Never replace an existing file wholesale.
- Append missing headings from `references/templates.md` only when compatible.
- If `.claude/settings.json` already has a different `agent`, do not overwrite it silently; return `BLOCKED target_instructions_bootstrap_conflict` unless the user explicitly requested the change.
- If `.claude/settings.json` already has a different worktree policy, preserve it and report the difference.
- If safe JSON repair is not possible, return `BLOCKED target_instructions_bootstrap_conflict` and list `.claude/settings.json`.
- If a required section cannot be inserted without conflicting with project-specific rules, return `BLOCKED target_instructions_bootstrap_conflict` and list the file.

## Procedure

1. Determine target root and requested runtime compatibility from `repo-init-scan`.
2. Read only the listed target instruction/adapter files that exist.
3. Create missing files from `references/templates.md`.
4. Append compatible missing sections from the reference to existing files.
5. Verify required paths, required headings, Claude import lines when applicable, and valid JSON when `.claude/settings.json` is present.
6. Return created, preserved, repaired, conflict, and missing path lists.

## Verification

- Confirm generated files exist in the target repository.
- Confirm path existence plus required sections; path existence alone is insufficient.
- Confirm existing files were not overwritten.
- Confirm `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md` contains request flow, reliability gates, native ask, memory/spec, `STATE_SYNC`, agents/dispatch, implementation/verification, and mixed-language rules.
- Confirm `.github/instructions/skills-index.instructions.md` contains Claude Code skill-name guidance when relevant.
- For Claude Code, confirm `CLAUDE.md` has standalone unindented imports for `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md`, and `.github/instructions/skills-index.instructions.md`.
- For Claude Code, confirm PM coordinator dispatch, foreground/background policy, isolated worktree closeout, scoped plugin agent names, namespaced skill commands, skill-load-is-not-execution, code intelligence fallback, TypeScript LSP fallback, provider compatibility smoke check, `AskUserQuestion`, and `STATE_SYNC` are covered.
- When a stable Claude PM entry is required, confirm `.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON and contains `"agent": "senior-project-expert"` plus `"worktree": {"baseRef": "head"}` unless a different explicit policy was preserved.
- Confirm no generated file contains unresolved project-specific claims, secrets, plugin-cache paths, or active plugin-package state.
- If invoked because instructions or adapters were missing and required files still do not exist, return `BLOCKED target_instructions_bootstrap_incomplete` with missing paths.
