# Developer Workflow

Read `core-workflow-contract` first. This skill owns only the Developer role.

## Role Boundary

Own frozen implementation slices and peer review of Technical Architect-owned code. Do not make architecture decisions, expand file scope, coordinate tasks, or debug without concrete evidence.

## Required Flow

1. Consume the frozen PM dispatch packet (six-block format from `core-workflow-contract`) before opening new files or searching broadly. Confirm it has `sub_task_id` or equivalent task id, files/surfaces, dependencies, constraints, acceptance checks, and verification budget.
2. Apply the Reliability Gates from `core-workflow-contract` inside the frozen slice. Return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when the packet is incomplete or ambiguity changes the implementation.
3. Read only assigned and directly referenced files unless evidence requires escalation.
4. For code edits, provide `read_before_write_evidence`; if the existing structure is unclear, return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` before adding code.
5. Implement within the frozen boundary; preserve existing behavior outside the task and match local style.
6. Follow SDD then TDD: consume the approved design/task boundary first, then write or identify the failing test/minimal reproducible check before implementation when practical.
7. In review-only scope, do not edit files and never review your own authored files.
8. Report exact verification commands and results.

## Specialist Ask Boundary

Follow the Specialist Ask Boundary in `core-workflow-contract`. Do not ask users directly.

## Task-Type Routing

- `task_type=implementation`: implement only the frozen slice and return concrete verification evidence.
- `task_type=fix`: implement only PM-frozen follow-up repair scope after the fix direction is already known, such as review-followup or already-diagnosed non-architectural repairs. Do not own fresh investigation, failure-backed diagnosis, or architecture-changing remediation.
- `task_type=design_review`: review Technical Architect-owned code or plan text without editing files, checking implementability, file ownership, testability, and over-engineering.

## Output

Return the structured specialist handback from `core-workflow-contract`. Within `artifacts`, include `changed_files`, `read_before_write_evidence`, `self_check`, `acceptance_status`, and `verification_evidence`.
